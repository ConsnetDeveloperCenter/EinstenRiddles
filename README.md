Please refer to the problem set in the **problem-set.md** file. 


How do I contribute my solution?
========================================
*   Fork https://github.com/ConsnetDeveloperCenter/EinstenRiddles on github.

*   Make a subdirectory for your language, if it isn't already there

*   Put your code in a subdirectory named with your github username

    > eg. java/johndoe

*   Include a README file with instructions on how to build/run your
    code. It needs to be a Makefile. Also, describe your solution if you feel like it.
    Refer to this link for help on the syntax

*   before you create a pull request, please make sure that your repository is up to date:

    > $ git pull --rebase

*   Send me a pull request so that your solution is included with the
    others. By doing this you agree that your code may be used by
